Sales requirements


If any product is sold to a customer and there is enough product on hand



Then the QOH column in product table should be updated.(You should think about creating a trigger).



else customer should be informed (email) that you are out of stock and products will be shipped on this date (to be calculated)



the quantity ordered should be placed on back orders



Order to vendor should be placed



> All our vendor has 3 days no charge delivery and 5% charge for ‘1 Day’ delivery



> Order date, expected receiving date, actual received date, shipper (similar shippers that we use for our sales



> Orders rec’d from vendor should increase the QOH



> Validate your development with your own test data and make sure it is posted in your report then rollback your changes



> All orders should be shipped 5 days after order date.
